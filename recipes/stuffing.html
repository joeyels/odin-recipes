        <p>Lovely Recipe Borrowed from the internet</p>
        <p> 
            This is the best stuffing recipe ever! Our favorite buttery 
            herb stuffing for thanksgiving

            Seriously, it’s our favorite stuffing and the only one I make 
            now. The edges are golden and crunchy, the inside is soft. It’s 
            wildly flavorful and buttery and filled with herbs and most 
            importantly, a delicious neutral flavor that truly goes with 
            any meal. 

            Stuffing is by FAR my favorite side dish. In fact, Thanksgiving 
            is alllll about the side dishes for me. Each one gets better than
             the last. And yes, technically this would be considered dressing 
            since I’m serving it outside the bird.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>18 to 24 ounces bread cubes, (1.5 loaves of bread, or 
                about 12 to 14 cups) preferably toasted or stale</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 cups diced sweet onion, roughly 2 large onions</li>
            <li>2 cups diced celery</li>
            <li>6 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>kosher salt and pepper</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh sage</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups chicken or vegetable stock</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>a mixture of fresh herbs for sprinkling</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Note about the bread cubes! You have options here. 
                Stale or toasty bread works best. The first option is 
                that you can cut 1 ½ pounds of bread into cubes, place it 
                in a large baking dish, loosely tent with foil and let it 
                sit overnight. You can also cut the cubes and put them in 
                oven, toasting them at 350 degrees F until they are like 
                croutons, about 15 minutes or so. Finally, you can buy the 
                toasted bread cubes in bags from the store. It’s your choice! 
                u can also choose the size of your cubes. They can be small or 
                larger for a more rustic stuffing.</li>
            <li>My mom has always used a mixture of stale and fresh bread. Also, 
                I like to use different kinds of bread (usually two), like a sourdough
                and italian, and mix the cubes. It provides great texture.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush a 9x13 baking dish 
                (you can also use a larger baking dish or a larger foil roasting 
                pan too!) with melted butter, olive oil or spray with nonstick 
                spray. Place the bread in a large mixing bowl (this may be easier
                 for you to stir!) or the baking dish that you will bake it in. 
                You can also separate this into two baking dishes if it's
                easier. </li>
            <li>Heat the butter in a large skillet or dutch oven over medium heat. 
                Once melted, stir in the onion, celery and garlic with a big pinch of 
                salt and pepper - at least ½ to 1 teaspoon each. Cook until the onions 
                and celery soften, about 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the sage, parsley 
                and rosemary. Cook for another minute. Stir in 1 cup of stock.</li>
            <li>Pour the onion celery mixture over the bread crumbs and toss well 
                to coat.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl or measuring cup, whisk together the remaining 
                1 ½ cups stock and 2 eggs.</li>
            <li>Pour that mixture into the bread cubes and stir and fold the bread 
                cubes until thoroughly combined. Bake the stuffing for 45 to 50 
                minutes, until the internal temperature registers 160 degrees F. If 
                the stuffing is getting too browned, you can tent it with foil.</li>
            <li>I have successfully made this a day ahead of time and reheated 
                it - it’s just as good! emove the pan from the fridge 60 minutes 
                before reheating it. You can also use this mixture to stuff the bird 
                if you wish!</li>
            <li>To serve 4: Cut this recipe in half exactly and bake it in an 8x8 or 
                9x9 inch dish. I bake for the same amount of time.</li>
            <li>To serve 12 to 18: Double this recipe exactly. Bake in a large baking 
                dish, like a 10x15 roasting pan, or baking in two 9x13 baking dishes. 
                I bake for roughly the same amount of time, or about 15 minutes 
                longer.</li>
        </ol>
