<h3>Description</h3>
    <p> If you're looking for comfort, look no further. Our Soulful 
        Chicken Soup is coming in hot and you're going to love it. The 
        trick here is to cook low and slow. Chicken, a few root veggies, 
        lots of fresh herbs, salt, pepper, and chicken broth are thrown in 
        the slow cooker before cooking away on the low setting for about 6 
        hours. When time is up, your chicken should be fall-off-the-bone 
        tender and ready to dice. Once you discard the bones and add the 
        chicken back to the slow cooker, stir in the noodles and parsley. 
        You'll turn up the heat and cook another 15 to 20 minutes or until 
        the noodles are cooked to perfection. The final touch is a hit of 
        lemon juice. It will enliven all of the flavors as they meld 
        together in one delicious bowlful. When you think of comfort food 
        recipes, chicken soup has to be at the top of your list. Lucky 
        for you, this slow cooker chicken soup recipe is about to become 
        your new go-to.
